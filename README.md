# GoWebProj

Simplistic Go Web App

Read about it here.

To install:

    You need PostgreSQL, install it somehow, make an empty database called gowebapp. (Usually createdb gowebapp on the command line is all you need).

    You need Go, preferably the latest version (1.8).

    Now do this:

$ export GOPATH=~/go # optional, adjust as necessary
$ go get github.com/grisha/gowebapp

    That's it. You should now be able to run:

$ $GOPATH/bin/gowebapp
